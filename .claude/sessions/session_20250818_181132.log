2. Implemented Hub listener for real-time auth state updates
3. Added proper auth context with user state management
4. Added "use client" directives to all components using hooks
5. Created middleware for clean routing
6. Set up /home as main authenticated route

**Code Changes Made**:

- Login form with real Amplify signIn method

**Current Status**: 
- Custom login page displaying correctly
- User authentication working with AWS Amplify
- Auth state management implemented
- Debugging auth redirect issue (user logged in but still showing login)

**Next Steps**:
- Debug auth state rendering issue
- Test complete authentication flow
- Verify redirect to /home works properly
